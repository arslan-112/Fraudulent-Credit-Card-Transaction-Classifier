# Fraudulent-Credit-Card-Transaction-Classifier

ML project to identify fraudulent credit card transactions

Complete workflow from preprocesssing, to training baseline models and then moving on to advanced models.
Can work on the model accuracy further, but I got tired. Will work on it in the future soon (Hopefully).
